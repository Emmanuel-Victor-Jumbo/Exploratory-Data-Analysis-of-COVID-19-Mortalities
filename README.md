# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-COVID-19-Mortalities


The aim of this geographic epidemiological project was to investigate the spatial patterns of United State’s COVID-19 deaths in relation to variables such as vaccination, hospitalisation and a variety of socioeconomic factors (eg. Per capita income). This was achieved by means of data sourcing, followed by the use of python and PowerBI for the preprocessing and examination stages. Where the data examination stage primarily involved creation of different plots, maps, graphs, dashboards and implementation of machine learning clustering algorithms. Some of the key findings of this project included:
* Death rate across counties in the U.S.A appeared to increase as the percentage of individuals below poverty increased, with similar trends visible when comparing percentages of uninsured individuals as well as unemployed individuals to death rate.
* While death rate across counties in the U.S.A appeared to decrease, as a county’s per capita income increased.
* Death rate across counties in the U.S.A appeared to decrease as percentage of fully vaccinated individuals increased.
* Discovery of the presence of Positive, spacial autocorrelation in maps generated from clustering relevant variables.
